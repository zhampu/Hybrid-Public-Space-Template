# Ways of  Listening

*what does it mean to listen?*

After almost ten years of free home university<sup>[^1]</sup>, my answer today would be: to suspend the impulse to find an immediate response, reacting or looking for (re)solutions, and stay in the not knowing, sitting with the discomfort in which we are left when something or someone asks for us to *really* listen.

Usually, these are the moments in which our utopian, well intended, politically grounded, at times self-congratulatory, theoretically supported entitlements are put in question, disrupted by a sudden crisis we did not see coming. We are confronted by the unexpected, the internal critique, or surprised by the offering of a doubt from a radical Other, the one coming from another knowledge system, an other embodied experience, or cosmology, whom we can not fully understand through our own categories of thought. These moments when a divergence of needs, goals, perspectives and feelings manifests even within a group that chose to be together, are precious as they force us to listen, otherwise.

*What type of listening is produced when we sit with our contradictions, paradoxes, complications and implications?*

Suddenly Razgar, a Kurdi cosmologist from whom we would end up taking kung fu lessons and  counted the time spent in Italy by saving the pens he consumed writing - broke the niceness of the situation - one in which a delegation from Ultra-red<sup>[^2]</sup> and free home university collectives visited a group of asylum seekers in their shared apartment, to invite them to be part of our project, our ‘militant research’.

He asked:

*do you know why we come here? what do you want from us?*



We thought we knew *why* “they” come, and even if we did not want to predetermine any results of our encounter and leave it open- what “we” wanted from them was the possibility for this encounter to happen. Moved by the desire to tackle the system of oppression and racism that migrant subjects face in our territory, we were up to offer an invitation and maybe share some tools, willing to center the knowlege of those more impacted, and support the emergence of  actionable strategies through our community engagement. We also assumed we could be allies, comrades, supporting a different but shared struggle.

So this time, for our third encounter, we decided to take the same bus ‘the guys’  (they were all men, and all with some medical conditions) would  take when commuting from Castri, a tiny village, to the main city of Lecce where they usually visit the migration office or  the ‘ethnic shops’ for groceries that might bring them close to a taste of home. We had waited a long time for the bus to come, and we witnessed how the spare “local’ commuters made sure not to sit close to the other passengers and looked at us, mingling and chatting, with curiosity. Of course, we assumed we had clarity about the question of our own privilege, and the colonial horrors committed by our ancestry, and the neo imperialism of neoliberal societies in the global North. After all we are internationalists, feminists, anticapitalists! We assumed we could be allies, comrades, supporting a different but shared struggle.

We knew our intentions to open a decolonial, and horizontal space of learning, in which we could also learn what then was named *unconditional* solidarity, and move towards a co-research in action, in which a collectively produced knowledge could bring some change in all our all lives at least facilitating  a bridging and a building  of relationship. But was that enough?

The blunt questions of Razgar, as we were sipping  coffee with *cardamomo* prepared by Alla, a Syrian fellow who would reveal rare painting skills - pushed us to listen deeply, and to check what it does really mean to feel our implications, and assess our lack of knowing.



The divide we wanted to avoid (we\they, us\them) was reproduced, simply by our bare presence: a group of international artists brought there obviously by other means than our hosts- visiting the  home of asylum seekers provided by the municipality and managed by an ONG; in case we would naively bypass our differences, am obvious question reinstated them. It had already happened the first time we visited, when the social workers reunited the program beneficiaries on the terrace and we sat in a circle to briefly introduce ourselves. This ritual soon became a sort of spectacle, aswith their  best intentions, he social workers insisted for our hosts to share their stories, the long and troubled journey to come here from Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria… their sickeness, their dreams to work here, to contribute to our society… It felt pushed and premature, we clarly percieved an asymmetry being reinforced, and sensed that we were inadvertently encouraging them to perform as refugees, migrants, asylum seekers, displaced people. different from us.

*what did we want from them?*

Luckily, a small accident, a mistake due to the  messiness of trying to put twenty people in a minivan in time for our appointment - reverted that uncomfortable situation: we had forgotten the bags of food and refreshments we had prepared to share food together, which was they way *we* had intended to start. breaking bread as a way to meet, sharing informally, without putting anyone on the spot, letting  roles to fade,  in a more convivial and organic atmosphere.

I have grown more accustomed, during these 10 years of what we tentatively call the free home universities- that mistakes are seminal in the pedagogical process. It is exactly when something goes wrong and the community struggle to act together, that a new learning is produced. Of course, we should avoid by all means to traumatize people, to reproduce the system of oppressions we intend to fight against (although some level of disruptiveness seems inevitable, as stretching our boundaries and coming out of our comfort zones can be painful). It is the friction that produces the heat, and there is a need to learn from, with and beyond our differences, but also to develop the tools that allow us to be uncomfortable and  work with the gift of conflict, with our dissonant positions, without tearing apart our relationships. More space would be needed to discuss how difficult is to live, work and create collectively, to build a commoning, even when it is what we aspire to the most. The way we are socialized, the habit of a privatized use of space, time, care, attention and the questions of meeting at different pace, of intersectionality or ego- all become even more dramatic when work across the multivocal and diversity.

The realization we had no rice, no lentils, nor salad to share instigated a spontaneous movement from our hosts, who listed what they had in their pantries, started to exchange pots and pans, as teams were formed in the various floors  to improvise with what was there.. Their homes were open to us, and the weirdness created during the presentation was replaced by a warm hospitality, abundance and curiosity. In the kitchen, stories were shared differently, together with spices, recipes, laughters, memories and the jolly sound of chopping, seizeling and deep frying, as the culinary inventions and adaptations from different part of the world were created.. The dinner was a feast that continued past midnight.  We said goodbye with a warm heart and we immediately invited them for the next day,  when we would cook our canadian, croatian, brazilian, united states, southern italian, russian, british, puerto rican version of rice and lentils

That next day, they arrived to our space accompanied by the social workers, and Micheal Robertson proposed an exercise as a way of reflecting on our time together, and i guess breaking the ice, as he proposed to consider our encounter as a “sound object’ -

in Ultra -red terms, ‘*a sound object is a sound in a relationship to it being listened to*’,  in general this means a short recording, either found or created, that is context-specific and is shared within a group , in an organized setting, as a way to start a conversation wich will be facilitated ina certain manner. Micheal expanded the original notion of is collective, to include our lived experience as a sound object, something we would continue to use in the future, and he went on asking:

*what did you see,*

*what did you hear,*

*what did you feel?*

he also clarified that the first and last questions were also his own additions to the group methodology and it was good to find out that even a “protocol’ that at the beginning might have felt as a fixed tool, was susceptible of adaptions. He explained that as a Black person the sound was somthing allowed , while the gaze was not, so he wanted to reclaim dialectically both senses, and add the affective dimension which is often excluded  by intellectual traditions.

The listening session to our ‘night as a shared sound object’ went on for hours, with Micheal facilitating and expanding the conversation, allowing for every one  feel listened seen and felt by the rest of the group. Something clicked,  a sort of intentionality was instaured, a listening  with our ears, hearts and thoughts, a moment in which the desire to be more together was forming

Collecting sound objects, engaging in sound walks, alternatively lead, and in other sound protocols as practiced by Ultra red, became the mode of our exploration and of our organization of time and space together, which we started calling *What's the Sound of Freedom.* In the following year, as Ultra red and other guests kept coming back to free home university, the inquiry contin*ued* as *What’s the sound of justice.*

Because we can’t be free until we are all free.

Ultra-red’s processes of listening, dialogue and reflection, constructed, as a political action that contributes as well as challenges collective organizing and relationship, remained strongly grounded in a day-to-day pedagogy of care and affinity.

*how does life in common would sound as an object in relation to it being listened to?*

Indeed, it’s not an exaggeration to say that our lives ( at least some of them) changed because of this encounter. With some it was the start of long lasting friendships, many other moment of learning and living together, even after people relocated. with other it brought an irreparable loss, and through some of that loss other understood how deeply we can touch each other. like when we Sharafat landed in rome with severe respiratory complications, after he insisted to fly to Afganistan to salute his dying father. One of us happen to be on his side on his final days in the  hospital in Rome. he was him that one night told me I was the boss and everyone agreed and started to make fun of me, and that on other day he suddenly turned the microphone to Andrea , their teacher of Italian, and asked:

*and you ? what do you see, what do you hear, what do you feel?*

That was an other turning point, it created an awareness, when we realized how, despite their attempt to stay away from our activities, in a spirit of generosity and conscious decision, nobody can pretend we are not affected, and that  the social workers were a very important part of this forming constituency. Elliot Perkins wrote a beautiful reflection on this ….

Exploring acoustic space as enunciative of social relations.

Ultra-red has worked, over the past twenty years, within and across a widely distributed network of communities mobilized in the struggles against racism, homophobia, rans-phobia, and poverty in relation to public housing, health, education, and migration. Their explicitly political art projects take sometimes the form of radio broadcasts, performances, recordings, or installations. In our case, even if we had the fantasy to produce a record with a montage of different sounds - what was produced was long lasting relationships, a methodology that has served all us us in different ways.

The pedagogical methods of listening developed by Ultra-red, organizing at the intersection of sound art and politics, were illuminating tools, for they provide a technology that invites positionality, intersectional concerns, and were  especially useful when working with intergroups, and when a self inquisitive set is fundamental to have.

# A Vocabulary for Digital Commoning Methods

Juan Gomez and Gregoire Rousseau

‘Station of Commons’ was initiated in early 2020 as a collective of artists, designers, and programmers to stand for the re-appropriation of technology within the public space. It situates itself now as an independent research project on digital commoning practices. Positioned at the intersection of art and design practices and radical technology, Station of Commons questions how collaborative processes embedded in technology can find form in new knowledge and know-hows within, against, and beyond capitalist modes of production. The current neo-liberal processes of extraction and appropriation over digital technology produces new spaces of objective contradiction between common interest and very narrow ones. These contested spaces[^1] operate as possibilities for the manifestation of commoning practices, for thinking and engaging in terms of art, design, and coding practices.

Departing from Station of Commons practice at large, this chapter inquires into the conditions and implications for commoners’ actions operating in the technological space. How can digital commoning practices rethink another model of shared empowerment situated in time and space, unique to its agents and communities? The methods for collective organizations operate as core research of this article. It examines ‘Lumbung Radio’ as a situation of work collectively thought with the artist collective ruangruppa in the context of art exhibition ‘documenta fifteen’. lumbung radio is a collective radio co-created with its participants as well as its operating infrastructure. With the intention of expanding the methodologies of collective artistic work, this chapter is written as a glossary of key words that are were fundamental to the creation and conceptualization of lumbung radio as a collaborative project and that could serve as reference for collective artistic and research work. Finally, the chapter argues that Digital Commoning practices refers to infrastructural and conceptual work operating together and elaborates in the sense of the multitude<sup>[^2]</sup> as proposed by political philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

**Digital Commoning Practice**

The necessity for artists to resist capitalist extraction operated by the market found form in collective organizations starting at the beginning of the previous century. The avant-garde movement, such as the Futurist one, revealed the power of a new type of intellectual formation: collectivity.<sup>[^3]</sup> Later, the Dadaist, Surrealist, and Situationist movements, among many others, formed groups against the artist being branded as an individual genius working under legal contract for commercial and institutional venues. The relation between the collective, as a political and social body/structure, and the space where the collective can operate, experiments with the ideas of autonomy, resource, governance, knowledge, and related means of production. Artists collectively want to think of this self-organized space as a laboratory, an extended studio for speculative inquiries, and a space in the making open to develop/implement social and political interventions.

The collective ‘ruangrupa’ (curator of documenta fifteen) founded ‘Gudskul’ as a platform for collective study to provide an infrastructure for local contemporary art. This so-called ‘artists-run gallery’ wants to distance itself from the exhausted model of the project inspired/copied from industry that is defined over a limited time and budget. The overall recent rapid development of technology/Internet/online tools questions the position of this other alternative/modern space in relation to the digital culture (and even more since COVID’s interference). The possibility for a radical and social imagination must venture forth to find form in the digital space.

Drawing from the definition of Digital Commons by Felix Stalder,[^4] we believe that transdisciplinary experiments within art and design can help foster new collectively imagined realities for a more just and equitable networked economy. Prior to Lumbung Radio, we curated the exhibition ‘Digital Commoning Practices’[^5] (2021)* that questioned the manifestation of radicality in the physical space that departed in the digital space. The opening of the exhibition coincided with one year of experimentations on audio and video streaming, broadcasts using open-source tools, and online libraries. The reason for all these experimentations were ignited by the first lockdown in 2020, in order for us to continue our work as sound artists, performance makers, and creatives in times of isolation and still resist the hegemony of narrow private interests in the technological space.

An audio stream is fragile online data. Contemporary methods of open-source streaming are based on a server-client[^6] model where the sound wave generated by the artist is mediated through a server that creates a mounting point for listeners to connect and listen to the audio stream. Taking this basic technical understanding of streaming, the infrastructuring process in Lumbung Radio is not hierarchical but heterarchical,<sup>[^7]</sup> as the infrastructure built on top of browsers, phones, and other objects of connection is thought through in a participative process considering the socio-technical conditions of commoners.  In this regard, the audio experience is thought of as an act of commoning through a shared experience and the digital infrastructure manages the distribution of the stream to serve the commoning process, rather than an individual one. This infrastructuring process of audio is not to be decoupled with its potential as a medium that enables animate contact producing complex ecologies of matter and energy, subjects, and objects.[^8]

**Lumbung**

Lumbung refers to the practice of communal rice barns in rural Indonesia, ruangrupa’s country of origin. Once farmers of a region complete their harvest, they share their surplus with the community. The farmers are not obliged to provide a certain amount, or a specific proportion of their production. They voluntarily put in the common pot what happens to be in excess in their own production. This common pot then supports less-fruitful harvests. This practice is based on trust, sharing, and building together. As mentioned in the documenta fifteen handbook, the lumbung values are ‘generosity, humour, local anchoring, independence, regeneration, transparency and sufficiency’.[^9]

Lumbung Radio is an online community radio project that has its starting point at documenta fifteen. As an open online broadcast, Lumbung Radio is comprised of an inter-local network of distinct radios and audio practices. It operates in no specific time zone and streams a wide variety of languages, music, and art. Each participating radio station or collective supports its own means of production, way of thinking, learning, and sharing. Lumbung Radio operates as a decentralized network of nodes that uses internet without its hegemonic agency. The intention is to produce an audiophonic common space built on the multiplication of the existing practices of its contributors. The radio runs on open-source infrastructure and is self-hosted on a dedicated server. The program comprises both relays and original contributions by its nodes, assembled via timesharing. lumbung radio’s network gathers over twenty collectives, active in radio and sound practicesl.

The server operates a key role in the practice of sharing resources at large. The server implements all the instances that lumbung radio collective uses on a regular basis. Among  the many instances the server provides, we highlight: the website and email server, the audio server, Jitsi conference solution, Cryptpad for secure text editing, Jamulus for real time online jamming, Nextcloud for file sharing. The website and audio are located in a professional server company, while the file sharing and other experimental instances are installed on specific machines (RaspberryPi for Nextcloud) in our own studios. We guarantee security by limiting the access rights to one qualified person in the Station of Commons collective. Indeed, the server administration happens to be a very sensitive issue as it concerns the pillar of many of our activites. These instances situated in the server result from a process of the determination of our actual needs, experimentations, failed and successful installations. This on-going process of new instances produces a double fold action. First, it situates the space where we meet, discuss, exchange, and as such work together. Then, the second action is reflective: this infrastructure produces a work on the collective itself. The infrastructure forms the collective as much as the collective shapes the infrastructure.

Station of Commons built a solid digital infrastructure that provides an exceptionally reliable audio stream. This determines the quality of access offered to listeners. One can listen to the stream using any common phone or computer. There is no requirement for high-end equipment, nor strong bandwidth internet to listen to an audio stream. The gesture of commoning happens by sharing artistic work without a need of surplus material, neither software nor hardware. Moreover, one connection to the server may be more than one listener. The audio stream departs from the sound artist to the server, until it transforms again into the analogue form. The same audio wave is then played on loud speakers across the world for a local mingling time. This act of sharing, which does not reduce the received part from another, produces a situation of collective counter strategy within the digital space.

**Acknowledgement**

Participants of lumbung radio include community radios, professional musicians, artists, designers, and curators, among others; the singularities of each perspective they bring is one of the shared resources that we strive to maintain. Station of Commons is positioned as a designer of relationships, taking an in-between position that allows for the full potential of this relational space of lumbung to escape definitions of being inside or outside: a parergonal space[^10] that persists in its non-defining qualities helping preserve the singularities thanks to the intersubjectivity of the agents that inhabit it. This place was both mediated by online meetings and a shared calendar.

The documenta fifteen prompting of lumbung implied an experimental way of organizing, where it was mainly collectives that participated in the discussions through extensive forms of ‘assemblies’ that took place prior to the key moments of the exhibition. How does one  define ‘we’ and its potentialities based on the difference of others? What was to be shared or  not ? Since sound was the first common thread  among us, it seemed to be a valuable point of departure to ‘establish a ground of negotiation rather than one of affirmation of what is shared’.[^11] The subjectivity and diverse practices were discovered throughout the process of worlding[^12] and a map of actors located in different parts of the world was drawn, showing different worldviews and interests; those actors also invited others, creating a network that expanded beyond the initial group of participants. Although sound is immaterial as a medium, it is  conditioned and subjected to time. Time became important as it not only determined the choice of tools to be infrastructured, but also the time to schedule for our meetings to take place. In this sense the digital commoning ritual of meeting is also limited by world distances.

In practical terms, this allows for the ‘non-expert’ to take voice in such an open environment for sharing their contributions—such as sound recordings, visual design, technology, and stories of past experiences that relate to all participants. In this regard, the whole ecosystem of inhabitants/communities, interactions, technologies, and points of encounters were taken into consideration. Keeping in mind that they will also impact us in a system of circularity and collectively, these tools will also shape our rituals, ways of doing, and modes of being.[^13]

**Process**

The commoning operative process departs from the standpoint that every participant learns from one another in the making of a common objective. Apparently, trivial questions may trigger new perspectives on common-day tools. The newcomer, because of the specificities of their own practice, operates a reflective gesture on the designed use of the tool. This process is an exchange of knowledge and know-how between practitioners that transforms into mutual learning. The communication unpacks the problems and develops solutions in a dialogical movement. This constant shift of positions produces the process of performativity within the technological space, whereas a digital common is being designed. The process of making/working together manifests beyond a technical achievement and produces a bond based on mutual acknowledgement.

Lumbung Radio collective’s effort bases itself on the participation of a multitude[^14] of radios, where each one defines their practice based on their intentions and the impact they hope to achieve. Among all the participating radios, technical discussions were brought up early-on regarding the means of production as of what technologies were used to stream and also what processes were put in place to operate their radio. ‘Critical Making’, as defined by Matt Ratto, is a process of creation where the designed object is not intended to be exposed, but where the process ignites a novel understanding of the system in which it is created. What is valued is the ‘making experience’*.* The formats of collective research given by the concept of Lumbung that were taken as a basis for the Lumbung Radio allowed for the formats of co-creation to be open ended, and in contrast to other collaborative commissioned projects, its precise form was not established. As part of the process, however, it was important to recognize the current production tools that were put in place for the different participants to operate their radio; this was exchanged in the weekly meetings, creating a consciousness of the practical tools put in place for lumbung radio.

**Conclusion**

This glossary of key words and phrases intends to invite and discuss the vivid constellation of practices hidden behind apparently simple words. The precise meaning, or what a dictionary provides, would only restrict a collective practice in the making situated in a specific context. The words selected to build/design this short glossary reflect the discussions, meetings, or formal presentations during the last years. They operate as conceptual articulations to think about how commons can find form embedded within radical technology and collective design. Radio, as a form of such collective organization, produces a social space based on decentralized means of production. During documenta fifteen, Lumbung Radio archived over fifty performances, concerts/events, and discussions/panels and is  actively still used as a space for experimentation for several fields. First, on conviviality through Peer-to-Peer technologies (mainly archiving and for infrastructuring). Secondly, as a platform for imagining new futures where communities practice the design of themselves or the design of a learning system about themselves.[^15] Finally, as a space for commoning through radiophonic experiences and their potential as enablers for criticality on the architecture of collective decisions.

They may include, for example, top-down hierarchies and bottom-up participation (both of which are vertical), and peer-to-peer dynamics (which are horizontal). In a heterarchy, people can achieve socially mindful autonomy by combining multiple types of governance in the same system. For example, a hierarchy form may exist within a heterarchy. Heterarchies are not simply peer-to-peer distributed ways of organizing, which are often hampered by a lack of structure. Nor is heterarchy the simple opposite of hierarchy. Rather, it is a hybrid that allows for greater openness, flexibility, democratic participation, and federation. When tasks are made modular, it becomes easier for heterarchical governance structures to flourish’.
