**A Vocabulary for Digital Commoning Methods**

Juan Gomez and Gregoire Rousseau

‘Station of Commons’ was initiated in early 2020 as a collective of artists, designers, and programmers to stand for the re-appropriation of technology within the public space. It situates itself now as an independent research project on digital commoning practices. Positioned at the intersection of art and design practices and radical technology, Station of Commons questions how collaborative processes embedded in technology can find form in new knowledge and know-hows within, against, and beyond capitalist modes of production. The current neo-liberal processes of extraction and appropriation over digital technology produces new spaces of objective contradiction between common interest and very narrow ones. These contested spaces[^1] operate as possibilities for the manifestation of commoning practices, for thinking and engaging in terms of art, design, and coding practices.

Departing from Station of Commons practice at large, this chapter inquires into the conditions and implications for commoners’ actions operating in the technological space. How can digital commoning practices rethink another model of shared empowerment situated in time and space, unique to its agents and communities? The methods for collective organizations operate as core research of this article. It examines ‘Lumbung Radio’ as a situation of work collectively thought with the artist collective ruangruppa in the context of art exhibition ‘documenta fifteen’. lumbung radio is a collective radio co-created with its participants as well as its operating infrastructure. With the intention of expanding the methodologies of collective artistic work, this chapter is written as a glossary of key words that are were fundamental to the creation and conceptualization of lumbung radio as a collaborative project and that could serve as reference for collective artistic and research work. Finally, the chapter argues that Digital Commoning practices refers to infrastructural and conceptual work operating together and elaborates in the sense of the multitude<sup>[^2]</sup> as proposed by political philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

**Digital Commoning Practice**

The necessity for artists to resist capitalist extraction operated by the market found form in collective organizations starting at the beginning of the previous century. The avant-garde movement, such as the Futurist one, revealed the power of a new type of intellectual formation: collectivity.<sup>[^3]</sup> Later, the Dadaist, Surrealist, and Situationist movements, among many others, formed groups against the artist being branded as an individual genius working under legal contract for commercial and institutional venues. The relation between the collective, as a political and social body/structure, and the space where the collective can operate, experiments with the ideas of autonomy, resource, governance, knowledge, and related means of production. Artists collectively want to think of this self-organized space as a laboratory, an extended studio for speculative inquiries, and a space in the making open to develop/implement social and political interventions. 

The collective ‘ruangrupa’ (curator of documenta fifteen) founded ‘Gudskul’ as a platform for collective study to provide an infrastructure for local contemporary art. This so-called ‘artists-run gallery’ wants to distance itself from the exhausted model of the project inspired/copied from industry that is defined over a limited time and budget. The overall recent rapid development of technology/Internet/online tools questions the position of this other alternative/modern space in relation to the digital culture (and even more since COVID’s interference). The possibility for a radical and social imagination must venture forth to find form in the digital space.

Drawing from the definition of Digital Commons by Felix Stalder,[^4] we believe that transdisciplinary experiments within art and design can help foster new collectively imagined realities for a more just and equitable networked economy. Prior to Lumbung Radio, we curated the exhibition ‘Digital Commoning Practices’[^5] (2021)* that questioned the manifestation of radicality in the physical space that departed in the digital space. The opening of the exhibition coincided with one year of experimentations on audio and video streaming, broadcasts using open-source tools, and online libraries. The reason for all these experimentations were ignited by the first lockdown in 2020, in order for us to continue our work as sound artists, performance makers, and creatives in times of isolation and still resist the hegemony of narrow private interests in the technological space. 

An audio stream is fragile online data. Contemporary methods of open-source streaming are based on a server-client[^6] model where the sound wave generated by the artist is mediated through a server that creates a mounting point for listeners to connect and listen to the audio stream. Taking this basic technical understanding of streaming, the infrastructuring process in Lumbung Radio is not hierarchical but heterarchical,<sup>[^7]</sup> as the infrastructure built on top of browsers, phones, and other objects of connection is thought through in a participative process considering the socio-technical conditions of commoners.  In this regard, the audio experience is thought of as an act of commoning through a shared experience and the digital infrastructure manages the distribution of the stream to serve the commoning process, rather than an individual one. This infrastructuring process of audio is not to be decoupled with its potential as a medium that enables animate contact producing complex ecologies of matter and energy, subjects, and objects.[^8]

**Lumbung**

Lumbung refers to the practice of communal rice barns in rural Indonesia, ruangrupa’s country of origin. Once farmers of a region complete their harvest, they share their surplus with the community. The farmers are not obliged to provide a certain amount, or a specific proportion of their production. They voluntarily put in the common pot what happens to be in excess in their own production. This common pot then supports less-fruitful harvests. This practice is based on trust, sharing, and building together. As mentioned in the documenta fifteen handbook, the lumbung values are ‘generosity, humour, local anchoring, independence, regeneration, transparency and sufficiency’.[^9]

Lumbung Radio is an online community radio project that has its starting point at documenta fifteen. As an open online broadcast, Lumbung Radio is comprised of an inter-local network of distinct radios and audio practices. It operates in no specific time zone and streams a wide variety of languages, music, and art. Each participating radio station or collective supports its own means of production, way of thinking, learning, and sharing. Lumbung Radio operates as a decentralized network of nodes that uses internet without its hegemonic agency. The intention is to produce an audiophonic common space built on the multiplication of the existing practices of its contributors. The radio runs on open-source infrastructure and is self-hosted on a dedicated server. The program comprises both relays and original contributions by its nodes, assembled via timesharing. lumbung radio’s network gathers over twenty collectives, active in radio and sound practicesl.

The server operates a key role in the practice of sharing resources at large. The server implements all the instances that lumbung radio collective uses on a regular basis. Among  the many instances the server provides, we highlight: the website and email server, the audio server, Jitsi conference solution, Cryptpad for secure text editing, Jamulus for real time online jamming, Nextcloud for file sharing. The website and audio are located in a professional server company, while the file sharing and other experimental instances are installed on specific machines (RaspberryPi for Nextcloud) in our own studios. We guarantee security by limiting the access rights to one qualified person in the Station of Commons collective. Indeed, the server administration happens to be a very sensitive issue as it concerns the pillar of many of our activites. These instances situated in the server result from a process of the determination of our actual needs, experimentations, failed and successful installations. This on-going process of new instances produces a double fold action. First, it situates the space where we meet, discuss, exchange, and as such work together. Then, the second action is reflective: this infrastructure produces a work on the collective itself. The infrastructure forms the collective as much as the collective shapes the infrastructure.

Station of Commons built a solid digital infrastructure that provides an exceptionally reliable audio stream. This determines the quality of access offered to listeners. One can listen to the stream using any common phone or computer. There is no requirement for high-end equipment, nor strong bandwidth internet to listen to an audio stream. The gesture of commoning happens by sharing artistic work without a need of surplus material, neither software nor hardware. Moreover, one connection to the server may be more than one listener. The audio stream departs from the sound artist to the server, until it transforms again into the analogue form. The same audio wave is then played on loud speakers across the world for a local mingling time. This act of sharing, which does not reduce the received part from another, produces a situation of collective counter strategy within the digital space.

**Acknowledgement**

Participants of lumbung radio include community radios, professional musicians, artists, designers, and curators, among others; the singularities of each perspective they bring is one of the shared resources that we strive to maintain. Station of Commons is positioned as a designer of relationships, taking an in-between position that allows for the full potential of this relational space of lumbung to escape definitions of being inside or outside: a parergonal space[^10] that persists in its non-defining qualities helping preserve the singularities thanks to the intersubjectivity of the agents that inhabit it. This place was both mediated by online meetings and a shared calendar.

The documenta fifteen prompting of lumbung implied an experimental way of organizing, where it was mainly collectives that participated in the discussions through extensive forms of ‘assemblies’ that took place prior to the key moments of the exhibition. How does one  define ‘we’ and its potentialities based on the difference of others? What was to be shared or  not ? Since sound was the first common thread  among us, it seemed to be a valuable point of departure to ‘establish a ground of negotiation rather than one of affirmation of what is shared’.[^11] The subjectivity and diverse practices were discovered throughout the process of worlding[^12] and a map of actors located in different parts of the world was drawn, showing different worldviews and interests; those actors also invited others, creating a network that expanded beyond the initial group of participants. Although sound is immaterial as a medium, it is  conditioned and subjected to time. Time became important as it not only determined the choice of tools to be infrastructured, but also the time to schedule for our meetings to take place. In this sense the digital commoning ritual of meeting is also limited by world distances.

In practical terms, this allows for the ‘non-expert’ to take voice in such an open environment for sharing their contributions—such as sound recordings, visual design, technology, and stories of past experiences that relate to all participants. In this regard, the whole ecosystem of inhabitants/communities, interactions, technologies, and points of encounters were taken into consideration. Keeping in mind that they will also impact us in a system of circularity and collectively, these tools will also shape our rituals, ways of doing, and modes of being.[^13] 

**Process**

The commoning operative process departs from the standpoint that every participant learns from one another in the making of a common objective. Apparently, trivial questions may trigger new perspectives on common-day tools. The newcomer, because of the specificities of their own practice, operates a reflective gesture on the designed use of the tool. This process is an exchange of knowledge and know-how between practitioners that transforms into mutual learning. The communication unpacks the problems and develops solutions in a dialogical movement. This constant shift of positions produces the process of performativity within the technological space, whereas a digital common is being designed. The process of making/working together manifests beyond a technical achievement and produces a bond based on mutual acknowledgement.

Lumbung Radio collective’s effort bases itself on the participation of a multitude[^14] of radios, where each one defines their practice based on their intentions and the impact they hope to achieve. Among all the participating radios, technical discussions were brought up early-on regarding the means of production as of what technologies were used to stream and also what processes were put in place to operate their radio. ‘Critical Making’, as defined by Matt Ratto, is a process of creation where the designed object is not intended to be exposed, but where the process ignites a novel understanding of the system in which it is created. What is valued is the ‘making experience’*.* The formats of collective research given by the concept of Lumbung that were taken as a basis for the Lumbung Radio allowed for the formats of co-creation to be open ended, and in contrast to other collaborative commissioned projects, its precise form was not established. As part of the process, however, it was important to recognize the current production tools that were put in place for the different participants to operate their radio; this was exchanged in the weekly meetings, creating a consciousness of the practical tools put in place for lumbung radio. 

**Conclusion**

This glossary of key words and phrases intends to invite and discuss the vivid constellation of practices hidden behind apparently simple words. The precise meaning, or what a dictionary provides, would only restrict a collective practice in the making situated in a specific context. The words selected to build/design this short glossary reflect the discussions, meetings, or formal presentations during the last years. They operate as conceptual articulations to think about how commons can find form embedded within radical technology and collective design. Radio, as a form of such collective organization, produces a social space based on decentralized means of production. During documenta fifteen, Lumbung Radio archived over fifty performances, concerts/events, and discussions/panels and is  actively still used as a space for experimentation for several fields. First, on conviviality through Peer-to-Peer technologies (mainly archiving and for infrastructuring). Secondly, as a platform for imagining new futures where communities practice the design of themselves or the design of a learning system about themselves.[^15] Finally, as a space for commoning through radiophonic experiences and their potential as enablers for criticality on the architecture of collective decisions.

They may include, for example, top-down hierarchies and bottom-up participation (both of which are vertical), and peer-to-peer dynamics (which are horizontal). In a heterarchy, people can achieve socially mindful autonomy by combining multiple types of governance in the same system. For example, a hierarchy form may exist within a heterarchy. Heterarchies are not simply peer-to-peer distributed ways of organizing, which are often hampered by a lack of structure. Nor is heterarchy the simple opposite of hierarchy. Rather, it is a hybrid that allows for greater openness, flexibility, democratic participation, and federation. When tasks are made modular, it becomes easier for heterarchical governance structures to flourish’.
