1.Smart is a term that functions as an empty signifier. It is susceptible to many interpretations. Similar terms interpreted from its use could be: intelligent, knowledgeable, creative, virtual, inter-connected and digital, among others.  
  
2.This thesis is concerned with what â€œsmart" indicates in infrastructure and technological innovation, rather than smart governance or e-government.  
  
3.I use the term DIY (Do-It-Yourself) as in using alternative methods and not standardized by industry. I use DIT (Do-It-Together) and DIWO (Do-It-With-Others) as of when this non standardized methods of doing things are made in a group of people.  
  
4.My intended form of this thesis  was in an HTML2PRINT work flow. For the sake of respecting the delay this version was design in InDesign but the coming Web Site and personal version will be made with Paged.Js.
