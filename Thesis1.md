1.Smart is a term that functions as an empty signifier. It is susceptible to many interpretations. Similar terms interpreted from its use could be: intelligent, knowledgeable, creative, virtual, inter-connected and digital, among others.

2.This thesis is concerned with what â€œsmart" indicates in infrastructure and technological innovation, rather than smart governance or e-government.

3.I use the term DIY (Do-It-Yourself) as in using alternative methods and not standardized by industry. I use DIT (Do-It-Together) and DIWO (Do-It-With-Others) as of when this non standardized methods of doing things are made in a group of people.

4.My intended form of this thesis  was in an HTML2PRINT work flow. For the sake of respecting the delay this version was design in InDesign but the coming Web Site and personal version will be made with Paged.Js.

Thanks to my supervisor **Lysianne Lechot-Hirt** for her patience and always goodwill to guide me when in doubt.

Thanks to [**Andrea Sick**](https://andreasick.de/) and [**Frieder Nake**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieder_Nake) who guide through the process in Bremen.

Thanks to [**Civic City**](http://civic-city.org/) for giving me many of the concepts that I elaborate.

Thanks to [**Genevieve Costello**](https://genevievecostello.net/) for proofreading the thesis.

Thank you all of those who have made an effort to listen to my ideas and develop them through discussions.



# Introduction
This text provides an overview and comparative analysis of select contemporary methods used in smart urbanism in physical spaces. It aims to contribute a critical understanding of best practices in contemporary urbanism and public space.

By drawing on interviews with practitioners, including artists, designers, architects, and software developers; and by conducting the comparative analysis of three cases, this research provides new and sometimes opposing perspectives on the issue of smart urbanism. The diverse methods that are examined are broad and I will try to establish a typology.

Issues of decision making for public space can be divided into bottom-up and top-down planning. Bottom-up planning prioritises the hyper-local and top-down planning prioritises a master plan that is commonly developed from an institutional point of view.

The interviewees and the case studies are situated in between these two planning methodologies. Hopefully, this way of proceeding will show how these two types of urbanisms are not exclusive to each other. In working together, they may be able to create a better dialogue for the process of place making in public space and lighten the number of points to be discussed in this process.

The rise of many of DIY and guerrilla urbanism practices can be attributed to the lack of involvement of inhabitants and users of public spaces in their co-creation. As well, the lack of legal structures that facilitate temporary intervention or activities in public spaces has contributed to the rise of DIY and guerrilla urbanism.

The three case studies were chosen to better understand positive practices for participatory methods for conceptualising, designing and implementing the cases' proposals. Two examples come from Western European cities and one is based in Russia, but with outcomes that are global. Despite many efforts of diverse local or national authorities for establishing participative processes in urban decisions, there does not seem to exist a rule of thumb for creating an open hybrid channel - that is, one that is both digital and physical - for civic discussion about the future issues of the city. This essay intends to be the basis for a developing hypothesis on how a hybrid public space could exist.

Drawing from texts by Richard Sennett and other thinkers dealing with the concepts of the Public Sphere and the commons, I share freely this research, its references and documentation in depth on a dedicated website to be published in January 2019: https:/juangomez.co/hybridpublicspaces.

This thesis aims to help users of public space understand the digital infrastructural narratives presented by many private and institutional stakeholders, as well as citizen and independent initiatives for the use and co-creation of public space.
